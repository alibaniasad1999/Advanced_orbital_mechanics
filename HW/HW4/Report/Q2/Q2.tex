\section{Question 2}
\subsection{Part a}
In this section used Algorithm 71 of refrence book. The code is in \texttt{Q2.ipynb} file. The result is in \texttt{Q2\_a.txt} file. The result is:
$$
a = 6585.691379586709_{km}
$$

\subsection{Part b}
In repeat ground track assumed the accepted drif error is about 1 persent of semi-major axis. So the error is about 50 km or 0.05 radian. Useng Algorithm 72 of refrence book, the result is in \texttt{Q2.ipynb} file. The result is:
$$
t_{drift} = 0.0018_{\sec}, \quad \Delta v = -2.31721_{\dfrac{km}{\sec}}
$$
